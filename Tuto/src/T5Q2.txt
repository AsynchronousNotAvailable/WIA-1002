2a) Explain what the lines of code do from line 2-11.
Ans: Remove the Node at the specified index from the doubly linked list


A doubly linked list keeps a set of characters. The head, the middle and the tail nodes respectively contains alphabet
‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’.
These nodes are in successive order. Create a new node that contains alphabet ‘z’.
Add this new node at the last location of this linked list.
Draw all of these nodes including their correct references.
