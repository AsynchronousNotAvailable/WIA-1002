My name is Lee Weng Hong with matrix number, 22004797. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling happy about taking this subject. This is because I will learn how to do advance programming.
I acquired A+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will fuck it. Wish me luck!!!
