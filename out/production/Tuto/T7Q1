1. Name four everyday examples of a queue other than those discussed during lecture.
    i. A line at a grocery store
    ii. A line at a bank
    iii. A line at a movie theater
    iv. A line at a restaurant
2. What is the difference between a queue and stack?
    i. A queue is a FIFO data structure, while a stack is a LIFO data structure.

3. Use the following code segment to answer parts (a) through (c):

   Queue<Integer> q = new Queue<Integer>(); Scanner keyIn = new Scanner(System.in); for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
   {
              if (keyIn.nextBoolean())
                   System.out.print(i + " ");
              else
                   q.enqueue(i);
   } }
        while (!q.isEmpty())
              System.out.print(q.dequeue() + " ");
        System.out.println();

  a) What is the output for the following input sequence?
        true false true true true
     Ans: 1 3 4 5 2

  b) Is it possible to have output: 1 3 5 4 2? If yes, give an input sequence that produces the output; or else, provide justification to your answer.
     Ans: No, it is not possible. The queue is a FIFO data structure, so the first element to be dequeued will be the first element to be enqueued.

  c) Give at least three input sequences that produce the output: 1 2 3 4 5
        Ans: true true true true true
             false false false false false
             true true true false false
